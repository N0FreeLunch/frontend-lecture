Assignment 4: Creating HTML from a Data Source

This week, your assignment is to iterate over an array of data to create an HTML document.

Start with:

Create your own data set or use the example data sets attached below
Print a unique container (e.g. a <li> or <div>) for each item in your data set.
Try to:

Style the document to make the data legible.
Extra Challenge:

Create a button with an event listener that will only show 5 pieces of data at a time.
Make the button work for "next page" or "previous page"


Example Files:

studio-ghibli-films.json download
Data stored as JSON file
studio-ghibli-films.js download
